# Tool Filtering Example
#
# Demonstrates fine-grained tool access control using patterns with wildcards.
#
# This example has three agents:
# - root: Coordinator that delegates to reader/writer
# - reader: Can ONLY read files (no write access)
# - writer: Can ONLY write/edit files (no read access)
#
# Usage:
#   eunice --list-tools                    # See all tools and agent access
#   eunice "Read notes.txt"                # Root delegates to reader
#   eunice "Write 'hello' to output.txt"   # Root delegates to writer
#
# Tool patterns support wildcards:
#   - "fs_read_file"     - exact match
#   - "fs_*"             - all tools starting with "fs_"
#   - "*_file"           - all tools ending with "_file"
#   - "fs_*_file"        - tools starting with "fs_" and ending with "_file"
