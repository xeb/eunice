Sample Notes File
=================

This is a test file for the tool filtering example.

The reader agent can read this file.
The writer agent cannot read this file (but can write to other files).
The root agent must delegate to reader to see these contents.

Key points:
- Tool filtering uses pattern matching
- Wildcards (*) are supported
- Each agent sees only their allowed tools
