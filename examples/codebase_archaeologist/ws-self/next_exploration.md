# Next Exploration Steps

## Priority 1: Configuration & DMN
- Analyze `src/config.rs` to understand how "Default Mode Network" is configured.
- Check `dmn_instructions.md` referenced in the file list.
- Understand how `agent.rs` uses the client.

## Priority 2: Examples
- Explore `examples/` directory.
- See practical usage of DMN and MCP tools.

## Priority 3: MCP Implementation
- Explore `src/mcp/` directory.
- Understand how Model Context Protocol is implemented server/client side.

## Questions
- How does the `agent.rs` handle the `thoughtSignature` from Gemini?
- What is the specific behavior of DMN mode in `config.rs`?
