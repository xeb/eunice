# Restaurant Simulation - Multi-Agent Example
#
# This simulates a restaurant with multiple agents:
# - counter: Takes orders from customers (root agent)
# - head_chef: Coordinates the kitchen
# - line_cook: Prepares individual dishes
# - supplier: Manages pantry inventory
#
# Run with: eunice "I'd like to order a burger and fries please"
#
# Tool patterns use wildcards: "filesystem_*" matches all filesystem tools
# Use `eunice --list-tools` to see available tools and agent access
# Use `eunice --list-agents` to see agents and their models
