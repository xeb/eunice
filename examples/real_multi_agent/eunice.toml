# Restaurant Simulation - Multi-Agent Example
#
# This simulates a restaurant with multiple agents:
# - counter: Takes orders from customers (root agent)
# - head_chef: Coordinates the kitchen
# - line_cook: Prepares individual dishes
# - supplier: Manages pantry inventory
#
# Run with: eunice "I'd like to order a burger and fries please"

[mcpServers.filesystem]
command = "mcpz"
args = ["server", "filesystem"]

[mcpServers.shell]
command = "mcpz"
args = ["server", "shell"]

# Counter - the customer-facing agent (root)
[agents.root]
prompt = "agents/counter.md"
tools = ["filesystem"]

# Head Chef - coordinates the kitchen
