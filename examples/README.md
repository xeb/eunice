# eunice Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating various eunice capabilities and use cases. Each example is self-contained with its own configuration, scripts, and documentation.

## üìö Available Examples

### ü§ñ [Multi-Agent Story Writing](multi_agent/)
**Complexity**: Advanced | **MCP Servers**: filesystem, memory

A sophisticated example showcasing multi-agent workflows where eunice orchestrates different "agents" to collaboratively create and refine cyberpunk stories.

**Features Demonstrated:**
- Complex multi-step agentic workflows
- File I/O operations via MCP filesystem server
- Memory persistence for tracking state between iterations
- Iterative improvement based on structured feedback
- Automatic retry logic for quality assurance

**Usage:** `cd multi_agent && ./run.sh`

---

### ‚è∞ [Simple Time Operations](simple_time/)
**Complexity**: Beginner | **MCP Servers**: time

Basic time queries demonstrating MCP time server integration and configuration discovery.

**Features Demonstrated:**
- Automatic configuration discovery (`eunice.json`)
- Manual configuration specification
- Time/date MCP server integration
- Simple tool calling workflows

**Usage:**
- `cd simple_time && ./run_default_config.sh` (automatic config)
- `cd simple_time && ./run_explicit_config.sh` (explicit config)

---

### üñ•Ô∏è [Shell Command Execution](shell/)
**Complexity**: Intermediate | **MCP Servers**: shell

Execute shell commands through eunice using the MCP shell server for system automation.

**Features Demonstrated:**
- Shell command execution via MCP
- Script automation capabilities
- System interaction through eunice
- Security considerations for shell access

**Usage:** `cd shell && ./test.sh`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: The shell MCP server provides powerful system access. Use with caution.

## üîß Configuration Files

Each example includes its own MCP configuration:
- `eunice.json` - Standard configuration file (auto-discovered)
- `config.json` - Custom configuration file names
- `eunice_minimal.json` - Reduced server sets for stability
